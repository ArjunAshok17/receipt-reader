# Receipt Reader & Splitter [DivvyBill] #
An app for easily divvying up bills based on what all you bought and used. This 
takes into account tax, tip, etc. and has functionality for custom divisions of 
additional payments (to divide up tax proportionally, etc.).

Future iterations will include built-in integrations for payments w/ Zelle, 
Venmo, and more.


# Tech Stack #
We're using Python [Tesseract OCR, Flask] for the backend, Firebase for the 
database and authentication, and React.JS for the frontend.
